                    <li>to acknowledge, confirm, and deal with your user account;</li>
                    <li>to send all new users a welcome activation email to verify their email address;</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>User account deleting</h3>
                <p>You may refuse to use our Website and/or application and may ask us to delete your account in the
                    Profile settings. Your account will be deleted immediately together with any subsequent personal
                    data you have supplied to us or we have collected. This action is irreversible.</p>
                <h3>Customer Service</h3>
                <p>When you contact us for support,we may process the data that you might have provided us to properly solve any
                    issues you might encounter.</p>
                <h3>API</h3>
                <p>If you are using our API (Application Programming Interface) services (such importing trades,
                    exporting reports), then we may process your personal data in order to provide and support those
                    services.</p>
                <h2>When would we share personal information</h2>
                <p>We share your personal data with third parties in the following situations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <!-- <li>Payment Information: Any transfer of money, we must provide payment information (name, payment card
                        information, full address and phone number). This information is used for billing purposes and
                        only processed by our payment processor.</li> -->
                        <ul>
                            <li>Business transfer: If we sell our business or our company assets are acquired by a third
                                party, personal data held by us about our general account users, subscription account
                                users or customer may be one of the transferred assets.</li>
                            <li>Administrative and legal reasons: If we need to disclose your personal data to comply
                                with a legal obligation and/or judicial or regulatory proceedings, a court order or
                                other legal process, to enforce our Terms of Use, House Rules or other applicable
                                contract terms that you are subject to, or to protect us or our contractors against loss
                                or damage. This may include, but is not limited to, exchanging information with the
                                police, courts or law enforcement organizations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Public information on our site</h2>
                <h3>Public Profile</h3>
                <p>Upon creating an account with us, all your information by default is set to private. Meaning no one
                    else have access to view your information. You can decide to share trade(s) with the public if you
                    wish. By doing so, you are responsible for what you share.</p>
                <h3>Public Content</h3>
                <p>There is no public content on our site. Every profile is private by default and no one other than
                    you, the user, can view your profile.</p>
                <h2>Security of personal data</h2>
                <p>We use technical procedures to protect your personal data.</p>
                <p>We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology in order to protect certain information
                    that you submit to us. This technology protects you from having your information intercepted by
                    anyone while it is being transmitted to TradeLab. While on a secure page, the “lock” icon in the
                    browser window is displayed, confirming that a secure and encrypted connection has been established
                    with the Website. We work hard to ensure that our Service is secure and that we meet industry
                    standards. We also use other safeguards, such as firewalls, authentication systems (i.e. passwords,
                    and personal identification numbers), and access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to
                    systems and data. If you have chosen to create an account, you are responsible for doing everything
                    you reasonably can to keep your access details secret. You must not share these details with anyone
                    else.</p>
                <p>We also do our best to protect user information offline. All of our users’ personal information is
                    restricted to our offices. This information is only accessed in order to provide our services or to 
                provide technical support.</p>
                <p>The servers that store personal data are located in a secure environment in a locked facility.</p>
                <p>We are constantly improving the ways we secure, store, and process the data we collect, including the
                    addition of physical security measures that help us counter unauthorized access to our systems.
                    However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot
                    guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                <h2>Children and sensitive personal data</h2>
                <p>This website and mobile apps are not directed to children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly
                    contact or collect personal information from children below age of 18.</p>

                  <h3>TradingView Integration</h3>
                  <p>
                    Our platform integrates TradingView widgets to provide chart
                    visualization and market data features. We want to be clear about
                    our relationship with TradingView:

                      TradeLab and TradingView are separate entities. We are not
                      affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected with

                    <li>
                      We do not share any personal information, user data, or trading
                      information with TradingView.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The TradingView widgets are embedded in our platform solely as a
                      feature for our users' convenience.
                    </li>

                      to TradingView's own privacy policy and terms of service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We recommend reviewing TradingView's privacy policy to
                      understand how they may collect and use data through their
                      widgets.
