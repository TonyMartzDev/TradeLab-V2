        <p><strong>Risk Disclosure</strong></p>
        <p>
          Trading futures and forex involves significant risk and may not be
          suitable for all investors. There is a possibility of losing all or
          more than your initial investment. Therefore, you should not invest
          money that you cannot afford to lose. Past performance is not
          necessarily indicative of future results.

        <p><strong>Hypothetical Performance Disclosure</strong></p>
        <div>
          <p>
            Hypothetical performance results have inherent limitations, some of
            which are outlined below. No assurance is given that any account will
            or is likely to achieve similar profits or losses as shown in
            hypothetical performance results. There can be significant differences
            between hypothetical performance results and actual trading outcomes.
            Hypothetical results are typically prepared with the benefit of
            hindsight and do not involve financial risk. They cannot fully account
            for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. Factors such as
            the ability to withstand losses or adhere to a specific trading
            program can affect actual trading results. Additionally, there are
            numerous other market-related factors to consider.
